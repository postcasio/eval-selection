# eval-selection package

Replaces the selected text with its evaluation as either JavaScript or CoffeeScript.

Code is evalated in Atom, so be careful and don't run untrusted code.

Default keybindings:

Keybinding | Command
--- | ---
alt-shift-j | eval-selection:eval-as-javascript
alt-shift-c | eval-selection:eval-as-coffeescript
